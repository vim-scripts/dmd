It's a quite poor ftplugin,but it work.

I permiss I will make a d language ftplugin as good as C/C++ have.
However, This is first step.

feathers:
   syntax highlight, it's official version.
   syntax fold, quick and dirty way.
   include search, set environment veriable DMD to dmd home, vim can search
all module under $DMD/import for symbol under cursor.(normal [i, [I ). gf key-sequeue open the module under cursor, too
   ctags support, there is a modified ctags support C/C++/D language.

todo:
   make comment works well.
   redesign syntax fold.
